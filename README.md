# Working with pandas
Within this challenge, I have chosen to analyze the PyCity School District. This data includes the school information (school size, budget, and type of school) and standardized test scores in math and reading. The original data files, csv, are in the Resources folder.

The data is analyzed to see if there is a difference in school budget, size or type when comparing test scores. This information will help the district in choosing standards for current and future schools.

## Table created 
1. Summary of the entire district
2. Summary of each school
3. The top 5 performing schools by percentage of overall passing grades in reading and math
4. The bottom 5 performing schools by overall percentage
5. The average math scores per school per grade
6. The average reading scores per school per grade
7. Scores based on school budget per student
8. Scores based on school size
9. Scores based on school type

## Results based on tables
With the charts that compare average passing scores (reading and math) to the grades the students are in, it is important to notice that the average scores across 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th grade students are very similar within the same school. The grade the student is in does not affect the average test scores.

Based on the table that compares school budget and scores, it is concluded that spending more money per student does not guarantee that the students will do better on standardized tests. The data actually supports that spending less money per student will help raise their scores.

According to the table that compares school size and scores, school size does make a difference in scores. The medium sized and small sized schools have relatively the same results and fair better than the larger school. So in conclusion, the school size shouldn't go over 2000 students.

Lastly, the table that compares school type and scores, shows that type is a very important indicator of the test scores. Charter schools have almost double the amount of students passing both math and reading standardized tests.

# Conclusions for district recommendations
Per the results in this data analysis, the district should attempt to lower the school sizes and model their curriculum based on the curriculum the charter schools are currently using.
